# My personal website (WIP)

This is a personal website built with Astro Starter Kit (Minimal).

The emphasis of this site is on **simplicity**, with optimizations for
**performance**, **accessibility**, and **SEO**. These optimizations are based
on the standards set by
[unlighthouse](https://github.com/harlan-zw/unlighthouse),
[web.dev](https://web.dev/measure/), and [gtmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)
audits.

While the site may not look visually appealing at the moment, improvements are
being made over time. There are many features I plan to add, but my primary aim
is to keep the site simple and focused on content.

> At first, when I started this project, I didn't think it would be this complex
> or require so many integrations. I guess I've been working on the frontend
> side in my comfort zone for too long , as my workplace hasn't allowed me to
> try anything new. This experience has been fun and enjoyable, reminding me of
> why I wanted to be a developer in the first place. It has reignited my passion
> for life, and I can't wait to see the finished site.
