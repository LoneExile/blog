# My personal website

This is a personal website built with Astro Starter Kit (Minimal).

> At first, when I started this project, I didn't think it would be this complex
> or require so many integrations. I guess I've been working on the frontend
> side in my comfort zone for too long , as my workplace hasn't allowed me to try anything new.
> This experience has been fun and enjoyable, reminding me of why I wanted to be a
> developer in the first place. It has reignited my passion for life, and I
> can't wait to see the finished site.

## Notes and thoughts

### Storage

Initially, I wanted to host a markdown file on GitHub along with the source
code. Since Astro is server-side rendered (SSR), it can fetch the markdown file
at build time. However, I realized it might be better to host the markdown file
on a cloud storage service. I considered the following options:

| Name                                                | Description                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/)           | A self-hosted personal cloud storage solution.                     |
| [SFTPGo](https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo)         | Fully featured and highly configurable SFTP server implementation. |
| [SeaweedFS](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs) | A distributed storage system for blobs, objects, files, and data.  |
| [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio)             | High-performance, AWS S3-compatible object storage server.         |
| [CouchDB](https://github.com/apache/couchdb)        | A document-oriented NoSQL database, sometimes used as storage.     |

I plan to self-host this project as I already have 2 Single Board Computers
(SBCs). First, I need to learn how to use
[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), which will help me set up the
system in the future. Additionally, I'd like to configure the SBCs into a
cluster for better performance and reliability.
