# My personal website (WIP)

The emphasis of this site is on **simplicity**, with optimizations for
**performance**, **accessibility**, and **SEO**. These optimizations are based
on the standards set by
[unlighthouse](https://github.com/harlan-zw/unlighthouse),
[web.dev](https://web.dev/measure/), and [gtmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)
audits.
